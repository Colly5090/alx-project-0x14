## Usage Limits and Best Practices

As part of RapidAPIâ€™s platform, this API enforces usage limits based on our free tier subscription plan for this project.

**Best Practices**

- **Use Pagination:** When retrieving large datasets, use pagination to avoid overloading the server and staying within rate limits.

- **Cache Responses:** Cache static data (like movie details) on your end to reduce repeated API calls.
- **Monitor Usage:** Periodically check usage stats on RapidAPI to avoid unexpected cutoffs.
